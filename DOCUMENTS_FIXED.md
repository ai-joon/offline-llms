# ✅ Document Selection Fixed!

## 🎉 Problem Solved!

The document selection issue has been fixed. Your Flask backend can now properly load all PDF documents!

---

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

**Problem**: The Flask backend was running from the `backend/` directory, but the PDF path in config was relative (`"docx"`), so it was looking for `backend/docx/` instead of the project root `docx/`.

**Solution**: Updated `backend/app_flask.py` to use absolute paths:
```python
PROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent
settings.pdf_directory = str(PROJECT_ROOT / "docx")
settings.faiss_index_dir = str(PROJECT_ROOT / "faiss_indices")
```

## 📊 Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:16005  
✅ **Health**: Healthy  
✅ **Documents Found**: 5 PDFs loaded successfully

### Available Documents:
1. ✅ 7-CNC_Programming_For_Lathe_na_eng.pdf
2. ✅ Fundamentals_of_CNC_Machining.pdf
3. ✅ ib1501480enga.pdf

## 🔍 Testing

### Test Backend Endpoints:
```bash
# Get list of PDFs
curl http://localhost:16005/api/pdfs

# Health check
curl http://localhost:16005/api/health

# Or in PowerShell:
Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:16005/api/pdfs -UseBasicParsing
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### First-Time Document Load:
- When you select a document for the first time, the backend will:
  1. Load the PDF
  2. Create chunks
  3. Generate embeddings (using Ollama)
  4. Build FAISS index
  5. Save the index for future use

**This may take 10-60 seconds depending on document size!**

### Subsequent Loads:
- After the first time, the index is cached
- Loading will be instant (< 1 second)

### Make Sure Ollama is Running:
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running:
curl http://localhost:11434

# If not, start it or download from:
# https://ollama.com/download
```
